LVM => Logical Volume Management
- Deploying logical storage rather than physical storage.

- Using Logical Volume Management (LVM) to manage storage:
A physical disk is divided into one or more physical volumes (PVs). 

These PVs can then be combined to create Logical Volume Groups (VGs).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Add a new hard disk of 50 GB in your system. The hard disk name must be the same as your name.

2) Create an extended partition of 50 GB.
Fdisk 
=> fdisk /dev/sdb
=> n > e > Enter in space

3)Create four (4) logical partitions of 10 GB each.
=> fdisk /dev/sdb
=> n > 

4) Create physical partition on second, third and fourth partitions.
#To show all partition
=> fdisk /dev/sdb > p 

#Create physical partition
in same menu => Pvcreate /dev/sdb5 /dev/sdb6 /dev/sdb7 /dev/sdb8
=> w > to save

5) Verify either physical volumes are created or not.
in same menu => pvdisplay

6) Combine second and third partitions into a group named “YourFirstName”.
 => vgcreate “test” /dev/sdd6  /dev/sdd7

7) Verify either volumes group is created or not.
vgdisplay |more OR vgdisplay test

8) Drive logical volume named "YourLastName" of 15GB from a group.
 => lvcreate –n “alawaidi”   --size +15G /dev/test

9) Verify either logical volume is created or not.
 => lvdisplay

10)Format logical volume with Linux default file system.
 => Mkfs.ext4 /dev/test/testt 

11) Make newly created logical volume usable for the uses.
#command displays the disk space usage for all mounted file systems in human-readable format.
 => df -h
 => Mkdir newdisk 
 => Mount /dev/test/testt  /root/newdisk/
 => df-h

12) Add 3 GB more in the newly created logical volume.
 => Lvextend  –L +3G /dev/test/testt 
#Update the partition table without formatting.
 => Resize2fs /dev/test/testt

14 )Add new physical volume (fourth partition) to the group.
 => Pvcreate /dev/sdd8 
 => vgextend “test”  /dev/sdd8

15) Verify either new volume is added to the volume group or not.
vgdisplay

16) Remove 2 GB from the logical volume.
=> Lvreduce -L -2G /dev/test/testt
=> Resize2fs /dev/test/testt
